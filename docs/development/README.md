# orbit-cloud-gcp: development

The supported Python range is declared in `pyproject.toml`. Local checks do not establish hosted CI or cloud-service compatibility.

```bash
python -m pip install -e '.[dev]'
pytest
ruff check src tests
ruff format --check src tests
mypy
python -m build
```

Provider tests use fake SDK clients and do not require cloud credentials. Live inventory checks must be separately opted in and run against a dedicated non-production account/project/subscription.

Strict mypy checks the adapter code. The Google API Core and Cloud SDK distributions currently do
not provide complete PEP 561 typing metadata, so the configuration narrowly ignores missing import
metadata for those SDK namespaces; it does not disable checking for Orbit modules or this package.

The current local quality matrix passes on CPython 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, and 3.14: all 5 tests, Ruff
lint and format checks, strict mypy, and wheel/sdist builds pass on each interpreter. These checks
use a fake Cloud Asset Inventory client; they do not verify IAM permissions, API availability, or
hosted CI.
